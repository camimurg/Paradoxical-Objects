## Video Sculpture Art From 1968 To Today

This online exhibition is designed and developed by me, curated by [peertospace](http://www.peertospace.eu/blog/2021/9/28/paradoxical-objects-video-sculpture-art-from-1968-to-today).

I used the Three.js library for creating the starfield background.

This is one of my first projects as a developer.
